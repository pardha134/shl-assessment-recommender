# Ultra-lightweight deployment requirements
# Total size: ~500 MB (vs 8.6 GB with sentence-transformers)

# Core API (essential)
fastapi>=0.109.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0
pydantic>=2.6.0

# LLM and RAG (required for recommendations)
langchain>=0.1.10
langchain-openai>=0.0.8
langchain-community>=0.0.25
openai>=1.12.0

# Vector Store (lightweight)
faiss-cpu>=1.8.0
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0

# Embeddings (needed for query embedding generation)
sentence-transformers>=2.3.0

# Configuration
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# Note: sentence-transformers is required for generating query embeddings
# Pre-computed embeddings are in vector_store/shl_faiss/
# But we still need sentence-transformers for new queries
